 abstract = {This article reviews Markov chain methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of a Dirichlet process mixture model and presents two new classes of methods. One new approach is to make Metropolis-Hastings updates of the indicators specifying which mixture component is associated with each observation, perhaps supplemented with a partial form of Gibbs sampling. The other new approach extends Gibbs sampling for these indicators by using a set of auxiliary parameters. These methods are simple to implement and are more efficient than previous ways of handling general Dirichlet process mixture models with non-conjugate priors.},

 abstract = {We describe and illustrate Bayesian inference in models for density estimation using mixtures of Dirichlet processes. These models provide natural settings for density estimation and are exemplified by special cases where data are modeled as a sample from mixtures of normal distributions. Efficient simulation methods are used to approximate various prior, posterior, and predictive distributions. This allows for direct inference on a variety of practical issues, including problems of local versus global smoothing, uncertainty about density estimates, assessment of modality, and the inference on the numbers of components. Also, convergence results are established for a general class of normal mixture models.},

 abstract = {In this paper we give a simple and new constructive definition of Dirichlet measures removing the restriction that the basic space should be Rk. We also give complete, self contained proofs of the three basic results for Dirichlet measures: 1. The Dirichlet measure is a probability measure on the space of all probability measures. 2. It gives probability one to the subset of discrete probability measures. 3. The posterior distribution is also a Dirichlet measure.},
