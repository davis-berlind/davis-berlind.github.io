## R Packages

* [mich](https://github.com/davis-berlind/mich) -- An R package implementing the Multiple Independent Change-Point (MICH) method introduced in [Berlind, Cappello, Madrid Padilla (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01558). The main function in the package `mich()` takes a length $T$ sequence of observations $\mathbf{y}_{1:T}$ with potentially many change-points in the mean and variance, and deploys a backfitting procedure to find a variational approximation to the posterior distribution of the change-points.
