I am a first year PhD student in the [Economics Deparment](http://www.bu.edu/econ/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). My research interests include econometrics, statistics, industrial organization, and applications of large-scale computing to each of these fields. I am also interested in public policy and have previously worked for the [Metropolitan Policy Program](https://www.brookings.edu/program/metropolitan-policy-program/) at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/), as well as the municipal governments of New York and Philadelphia.

Before coming to BU, I completed my M.S. in Economics and Computation at Duke University. At Duke I worked as a research assistant for [Christopher Timmins](https://sites.duke.edu/christophertimmins) in Duke's [Environmental Justice Lab](https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/project/environmental-justice-lab). I also worked in the Department of Sastistical Science as a research assistant for [Rebecca Steorts](https://resteorts.github.io/index.html), researching methods and developing software for Bayesian record linkage.
