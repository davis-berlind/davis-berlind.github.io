I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the [Deparment of Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) where I am advised by [Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io/). I am currently working on developing Bayesian and nonparametric methods for change-point detection problems. My research interests include:  
* Change-Point Detection 
* Bayesian Methods 
* High-Dimensional and Nonparametric Statistics 
* Social Statistics and Network Problems 
* Causal Inference 
* Record Linkage  

Before starting my PhD, I worked on public policy for the municipal governments of New York and Philadelphia, and interned for the [Metropolitan Policy Program](https://www.brookings.edu/program/metropolitan-policy-program/) at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/). As an analyst in the NYC Mayor's Office of Management and Budget, I assisted in the early stages of research that went into designing NYC's congestion pricing policy.
