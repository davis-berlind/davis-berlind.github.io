I am a third year PhD student in the [Deparment of Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/).
I am advised by [Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io/).
My research interests include Bayesian modeling, social statistics, causal inference, and applications of high-performance computing to each of these fields. 

I am also interested in public policy and have previously worked for the municipal governments of New York and Philadelphia, as well as for the
[Metropolitan Policy Program](https://www.brookings.edu/program/metropolitan-policy-program/) at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/).
Before coming to UCLA I spent the 2020-2021 academic year as a PhD student in the Economics Department at Boston University.

While completing my [MS in Economics and Computation](https://econ.duke.edu/masters-programs/degree-programs/msec) at Duke University, I held two positions as 
a research assistant: 
* I worked with Dr. [Christopher Timmins](https://sites.duke.edu/christophertimmins) on completing a long-term data validation project and other spatial data
analysis projects for Duke's [Environmental Justice Lab](https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/project/environmental-justice-lab). 
* I worked in the lab of Dr. [Rebecca Steorts](https://resteorts.github.io/index.html), where I developed software for implementing Bayesian record
linkage methods.
