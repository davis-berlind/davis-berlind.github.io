I am a first year PhD student in the [Economics Deparment](http://www.bu.edu/econ/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). My research interests include econometrics, statistics, industrial organization, and applications of large-scale computing to each of these fields. I am also interested in public policy and have previously worked for the municipal governments of New York and Philadelphia, as well as for the [Metropolitan Policy Program](https://www.brookings.edu/program/metropolitan-policy-program/) at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/).

Before coming to BU, I completed my [M.S. in Economics and Computation](https://econ.duke.edu/masters-programs/degree-programs/msec) at Duke University. While pursuing my degree, I held two positions as a research assistant: 
* I worked with Dr. [Christopher Timmins](https://sites.duke.edu/christophertimmins) on completing a long-term data validation project and other spatial data analysis projects for Duke's [Environmental Justice Lab](https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/project/environmental-justice-lab). 
* I also worked in the lab of Dr. [Rebecca Steorts](https://resteorts.github.io/index.html), where I developed software for implementing Bayesian record linkage methods.
